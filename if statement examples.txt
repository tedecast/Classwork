You’ve got the right idea! But the ‘else if’ blocks aren’t nested in each other, so they wouldn’t be indented:

if(something){
  do something
} else if (something else){
  do something different
}

If you had an if statement inside of another one though, you would indent:

if (check) {
  if (more specific check){
    do something
  }
}

Notice that ‘{‘ and ‘}’ give you an idea of when to indent. They’re like those Russian nesting dolls, one inside the other
